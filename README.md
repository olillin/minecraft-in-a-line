# Minecraft in a LINE

> A line is one dimensional, not two

This data pack was inspired by [ekvyn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS34eHTzG7Q) who modified [Linecraft by Vexxen Creations](https://modrinth.com/datapack/minecraft,-but-i-can-only-walk-in-a-straight-line), who in turn was inspired by [this video by WadZee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDpFnG7llpY).
